## TODO
# push the original project
need to push the original one-file project, which needs to be optimized on to the git storage.
# Reformat the code
need to use different structure and algorithm to reformat the code.
# A new tast
need to extend the code which supports more inputs and outputs, to make it a relatively complete project using different tools.
